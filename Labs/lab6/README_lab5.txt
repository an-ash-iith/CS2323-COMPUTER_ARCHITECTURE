Introduction:- It is c++ code to add nop instruction in the case of forwarding(by passin) and non-forwarding

my file name is CE21BTECH11008_LAB5

Non-forwarding:-

 use the command :  lab6

compile: g++ lab6  (this will compile the code and make a.out executable file)

Excuting: .\a.exe (to execute the code)

"g++ source.cpp -o output"  can also be used for getting executable file name as "output"


forwarding:-

 use the command : lab5_withforwading.cpp

compile: g++ lab6.cpp  (this will compile the code and make a.out executable file)

Excuting: .\a.exe (to execute the code)


"g++ source.cpp -o output"  can also be used for getting executable file name as "output"
  
Now it will take number of instruction and then instruction as string format.

runnung will give the result in terminal
